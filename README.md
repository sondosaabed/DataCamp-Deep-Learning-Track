# DataCamp-Deep-Learning-Track

In this track, I expanded my deep learning knowledge and took my machine learning skills to the next level. Working with Keras and TensorFlow, I learned about neural networks, the workflows of deep learning models, and how to optimize models. I used TensorFlow to build linear regression models and neural networks. Throughout the track, I applied machine learning techniques to solve real-world challenges, such as predicting housing prices, building a neural network for handwritten number prediction, and identifying forged banknotes. By the end of the track, I was ready to use Keras to train and test complex, multi-output networks and delved deeper into the realm of deep learning.
